CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) example app using React with Material UI, React Hook Form, and Yup for validation.
React MUI CRUD App with Form Validation

Click to open codeTap to open
For this CRUD application to work, you'll need to install the following dependencies:
bashCopynpm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-hook-form yup
Features of this CRUD Application

Complete CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new users with validated form inputs
Read: Display all users in a table
Update: Edit existing user information
Delete: Remove users from the list

Form Validation using React Hook Form and Yup:

Name must be at least 3 characters
Email must be in valid format
Phone number must be exactly 10 digits
All fields are required

UI Components with Material UI:

Responsive table for displaying users
Dialog modal for add/edit forms
Notification system with Snackbar
Icon buttons for actions

State Management:

Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
Form state handled by React Hook Form

This example demonstrates a complete working application that you can expand upon with additional features like filtering, sorting, pagination, or connecting to a backend API instead of using the in-memory array.

I'll refactor the CRUD application into smaller, more manageable components. This approach will improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

Refactoring Benefits
I've refactored the application into smaller components with a clear separation of concerns. Here's how the structure is organized:
File Structure
Copysrc/
├── App.jsx # Main application component
├── components/
│ ├── UserTable.jsx # Displays users in a table
│ ├── UserForm.jsx # Form for adding/editing users
│ └── AddUserButton.jsx # Button to add new users
└── validation/
└── schemas.js # Yup validation schemas
Key Improvements

Separation of Concerns:

Each component has a single responsibility
Code is more readable and maintainable
Easier to test individual components

Reusability:

Components can be reused in different parts of the application
UserForm component handles both creating and editing users

Maintainability:

Bug fixes and feature additions are easier when components are smaller
New developers can understand the codebase more quickly

Scalability:

Easy to add new components as the application grows
Validation logic is separated into its own module

Prop Drilling:

Data and callbacks are passed down to child components
Makes component dependencies explicit

With this architecture, you can easily expand the application by adding features like user search, filtering, or pagination without having to modify existing components substantially.
